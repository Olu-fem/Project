# Project
To implement a breast cancer detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with U-Net, AlexNet, and ResNet on histopathological images, you'll be creating a deep learning pipeline to classify and segment cancerous tissue. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step summary of how this project could be structured on GitHub, with links to the relevant code sections.

1. Project Overview
Goal: Develop a deep learning model to classify breast cancer in histopathological images by comparing U-Net, AlexNet, and ResNet architectures.
Dataset: Use the BreakHis dataset or another histopathological dataset with labeled cancerous and non-cancerous tissue images.
Model Comparison: Measure performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to determine the most suitable mode
